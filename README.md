### About: 

Emagnet Scraper is a monitor tool so we can grab all urls from scrape.pastebin.com/api_scrape.php and store all uploads on our own server and share to people

Setup your own server for emagnet and store both pastebin-api.txt (full api) && pastebin.txt (raw files)

### Getting Started

# Install apache2 or ngins and configure it after your needs:

    ,-> Create a folder in /var/www/html/emagnet/pastebin
    |   From now you will have things stored like:
    |   Recent uploads stored as raw format:            /var/www/html/emagnet/pastebin/yyy-mm-dd/pastebin.txt 
    |   Recent uploads will also be stored in json: :   /var/www/html/emagnet/pastebin/yyy-mm-dd/pastebin.txt
    |
    |           For find your own urls or at emagnet server, you can do as below:
